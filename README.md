# Machine Documentation Repository

Welcome to my machine documentation repository! This repo contains detailed write-ups showcasing the tools, techniques, and processes I use to tackle HackTheBox and TryHackMe machines as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by machine name, with each folder containing relevant files and documentation:

```
MachineName/
├── README.md            # Overview and summary of the machine
├── enumeration.txt      # Notes and results related to enumeration
├── exploitation.txt     # Steps and details related to exploitation
├── post-exploitation.txt # Notes and results for post-exploitation
```

## 🛠️ Methodology

The documentation for each machine follows these key stages:

1. **Service Scanning**: Identifying open ports and services running on the target.
2. **Enumeration**: Gathering detailed information about services, directories, and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation**: Utilizing discovered vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Escalating privileges, maintaining access, and analyzing the target further.
