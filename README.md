# Machine Documentation Repository

Welcome to my machine documentation repository! This repo contains detailed write-ups showcasing the tools, techniques, and processes I use to tackle HackTheBox and TryHackMe machines as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by machine name, with each folder containing relevant files and documentation:

```
RepoRoot/
├── README.md            # Overview of the entire repo
├── HackTheBox-Titanic/  # Documentation for HackTheBox Titanic machine
│   ├── README.md        # Detailed documentation for Titanic
│   ├── nmap-results.txt # Nmap scan results
│   ├── gobuster-results.txt # Gobuster directory enumeration results
│   ├── screenshots/     # Visual evidence of processes and results
├── TryHackMe-Machine2/  # Documentation for another machine (future addition)
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── notes/
│   ├── screenshots/
```

## 🛠️ Methodology

The documentation for each machine follows these key stages:

1. **Service Scanning**: Identifying open ports and services running on the target.
2. **Enumeration**: Gathering detailed information about services, directories, and potential entry points.
3. **Exploitation**: Utilizing discovered vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Escalating privileges, maintaining access, and analyzing the target further.
